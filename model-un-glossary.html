                <h2>Motion</h2>
                <p>A specific action proposed by a delegate to guide the debate in a particular direction. Motions are used to open or close debate, call for a caucus, or take other procedural actions.</p>

                    <h3>How to use:</h3>

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>Unmoderated Caucus (un-mod)</h2>
                <p>A motion to temporarily suspend formal debate and allow delegates to leave their seats and engage in informal discussions. This is typically used to form **blocs**, draft working papers, or merge ideas. The time for an un-mod is set in multiples of five minutes.</p>
                <div class="how-to-use">
                    <h3>How to use:</h3>

                <h2>Moderated Caucus (mod)</h2>
                <p>A motion for a structured, time-limited debate on a specific sub-topic. The Chair selects speakers who each get a set amount of time to give a short speech. This helps focus the discussion on key issues.</p>

                <h2>Point of Personal Privilege</h2>
                <p>A point used to address a personal issue that is hindering a delegate's ability to participate, such as needing to use the restroom, being too cold, or not being able to hear the speaker.</p>
                <div class="how-to-use">

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>Directive (Crisis)</h2>
                <p>A written document outlining a series of actions proposed by a delegate or a small group of delegates in a crisis committee. Directives need a minimum number of **signatories** and are voted on to be implemented by the committee. They are the primary way delegates take action in crisis simulations.</p>

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>Working Paper / Draft Resolution (GA)</h2>
                <p>These documents are the formal proposals for solving the committee's topic. A **working paper** is a preliminary, informal draft. Once it's more complete and polished, it becomes a **draft resolution**. Draft resolutions have a specific format with preambulatory and operative clauses and require a certain number of **sponsors** and **signatories** to be introduced and voted on.</p>

                <h2>"Decorum!"</h2>
                <p>A command used by the Chair to call the committee to order. When the room becomes too loud or delegates are unfocused, the Chair will often bang the gavel and call for "Decorum!" to regain everyone's attention. Only the Chair can use this term in committee.</p>
                <div class="how-to-use">
                    <h3>How to use:</h3>
                    <p>Chair: "Decorum, delegates!"</p>

            </article>

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>Bloc</h2>
                <p>A group of delegates who share similar opinions and work together to write a working paper or draft resolution. Blocs are typically formed during unmoderated caucuses after delegates have voted on a topic and shared their initial ideas.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>Sponsors</h2>
                <p>The primary authors and key contributors of a draft resolution or directive. Being a sponsor means you strongly support the document and will actively defend its content during debate. Sponsors are determined by the delegates within a **bloc**.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>Signatories</h2>
                <p>Delegates who wish to see a draft resolution or directive debated by the committee. Signing a document as a signatory doesn’t mean you fully agree with every single clause; it simply indicates that you believe it's worthy of discussion and a vote.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>Mergers / Merging</h2>
                <p>The process of combining two or more draft resolutions or working papers into a single, comprehensive document. This typically occurs when multiple **blocs** have similar solutions, allowing them to join forces and create a stronger, more supported proposal.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>The Backroom</h2>
                <p>The "off-stage" control center for crisis committees. This is where the crisis staff operates, monitoring delegate actions, writing and coordinating **crisis updates**, and managing the flow of the simulation. It's the engine that drives the narrative of the crisis, unseen by the delegates in the committee room.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>Crisis Updates</h2>
                <p>Unexpected events or challenges introduced by the crisis staff that delegates must respond to. Updates can be major world events, a natural disaster, or a political assassination. They are designed to keep the committee dynamic and require delegates to think on their feet and adapt their strategies quickly.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="glossary-item">
                <h2>Crisis Pads</h2>
                <p>Specialized notes or message pads used by delegates in crisis committees to send messages to the crisis staff in **the backroom**. These pads are the official way to communicate with outside sources and influence the narrative of the committee.</p>
                <div class="how-to-use">
                    <h3>How to use:</h3>
                    <p>Crisis pads should only be used for letters and not for taking general notes. It is recommended that you bring a separate notebook for notes.</p>
