            <h1>Mastering Your First Position Paper</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">By Joshua Varon | July 27, 2025 | Category: MUN Prep</p>

            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>Your first Model UN position paper can feel like a monumental task: between finding the perfect sources and researching the strongest actions your country has historically taken, the process of writing a position paper can easily overwhelm even the most experienced delegate.</p>

                <p>So where do you start?</p>

                <p>When I sit down to start writing my position paper, I like to already have a good idea about the overall standing of my country. Do I represent a country with advanced education? What about healthcare? What is the status of women's rights? Once I feel like I have a good understanding of where my country is, it becomes easier to see where I need to take it.</p>

                <p>I'll begin by defining the problem in my own words: “The Republic of Iceland is troubled by the rising trends in global temperatures.” From there, I try to spring to a description of what my country has already done. By citing previous actions, along with the effects they have had on the problem, I am able to assert myself as an authority as I go on to describe what my country proposes our committee should do.</p>

                <p>While I write, I try to hold my endpoint in mind. Researching evidence to support your claims is a lot easier when you know what you actually want to claim. I often find myself going back to add an additional piece of evidence in an early paragraph after realizing that I haven't provided strong enough support for a part of my overall claim.</p>

                <p>“But Joshua,” you may be saying, “deciding on a claim is the hardest part!” Don't worry. You don't need to find the perfect position to write the perfect position paper. The best positions are often the ones the delegate has the most familiarity with; by drawing from your own experiences, you will be able to develop a more robust position than if you have to only rely on information you find while doing your research.</p>

                <p>The best position papers have voice. They feel urgent. They don't read like a list of facts, monotonous; they sing with persuasion and emotion. Don't shy away from using vivid language! The most memorable parts of your position paper will be the ones that say “our government is appalled by the very notion” or “The Commonwealth of Australia has undertaken a bold mission.”</p>

                <p>And take risks! Unlike math, Model UN doesn't have one right answer. Really, it doesn't have right answers at all. A Model UN conference is an opportunity to push yourself out of your comfort zone, and it starts as early as the position paper. The position paper I grew the most from writing wasn't the one about The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Weapons Systems; it was the one I wrote about The International Adoption System.</p>
