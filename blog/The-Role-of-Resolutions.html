            <h1>The Role of Resolutions in Model UN</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">By Alexander Rechitsky | July 30, 2025 | Category: MUN Prep</p>

            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>In every Model UN committee, there will come a point where your hard work pays off and your bloc will come to agreement on a final, complete solution. While it may make sense to think that your work in committee is finished, there is still a very important step ahead: your draft resolution. It is now time to turn your wonderful ideas into a formal document that you and your bloc will work to pass. This document--your draft resolution--outlines your proposed answers to the matters being discussed. It is the tool that transforms your plan into actionable policy. </p>

                <p>It is important to note, though, that not all committees operate this way. Resolutions are primarily used in General Assembly (GA) committees and specialized agencies, where delegates work collaboratively to write official documents that reflect consensus among most of the delegates. In contrast, crisis committees move at a much faster pace and will instead use directives to move their interests forward; directives are short, immediate plans of action that directly influence the course your committee will take.</p>

                <p>When your bloc is ready to start working on a resolution (often called a working paper in its initial draft form), it is important that everyone agrees on the information the paper will include. At this stage, a group of three to five delegates is ideal, striking a balance between staying focused and including multiple perspectives. You will begin writing your resolution by choosing a title, which is usually an acronym that reflects the problems being addressed (although any memorable title will do). Next, you must determine the sponsors (authors) of the resolution and gather signatories to sign off on your resolution. Signatories are delegates who may not necessarily support your resolution, but believe that it should be presented so that the committee can debate it. You should always consult your committee chair(s) to confirm the required number of sponsors or signatories for each resolution, as this number may vary depending on the size of the committee.</p>

                <p>The body of each resolution follows a specific structure. They will begin with preambulatory clauses, which justify the committee’s reason for action on this issue. These clauses are typically short and start with phrases like “recognizing,” “noting,” or “acknowledging,” to briefly explain which concerns are being addressed. Afterward, you will start work on the main body of the resolution: the operative clauses. These clauses outline the specific measures needed to address the issue, broken down into clear steps. Often longer and more detailed, operative clauses are the “meat” of your actual solution. Resolutions can include as little as three operative clauses or as many as ten, although the actual amount of operative clauses will depend on what you decide to include in your resolution. </p>

                <p>Once the draft resolution is complete, it’s time to introduce it to the rest of the committee. Most committees will have multiple blocs writing different working papers. Each group will present their draft and answer any questions that other delegates may have. This process is often followed by mergers, where blocs with similar ideas can come together to combine their resolutions into a stronger, more unified document. Merging is a key part of the process as it encourages collaboration and compromise to achieve the best solution possible.</p>

                <p>Once merging is complete, the finalized resolutions are presented again. At this point, delegates may also propose amendments to resolutions before entering the final vote. If any resolution gains the necessary approval, it officially passes and your committee's work on this subject is typically complete. Even if your resolution doesn’t pass, your work still represents significant progress as you have successfully translated thoughtful collaboration into meaningful solutions. Regardless of what comes next, your efforts have strengthened the committee’s work and shown the impact of teamwork and critical thinking.</p>

                    Alexander Rechitsky is a motivated sophomore at Deerfield High School who is excited to co-chair his first committee at the upcoming JAMUN conference. Previously, Alex served on JAMUN’s crisis staff, where he supported delegates in understanding the structure of crisis committees and helped them refine their directive-writing skills. Outside of Model UN, he is a member of the school’s tennis team and has a strong interest in historical research. He looks forward to contributing to a productive and engaging committee experience for all delegates.
