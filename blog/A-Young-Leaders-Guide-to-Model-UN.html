            <p class="post-meta">By Alexandra Fumerton | July 30, 2025 | Category: Reflections</p>

            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>Hi, my name is Alexandra Fumerton. I have been doing Model UN for five years now, and this year I had the privilege of chairing the UNHCR committee at JAMUN II. Model UN has been a large part of my high school life, and as I prepare to enter college, I hope to not only continue competing in conferences, but to use my experience to inspire and educate the young leaders of the world.</p>

                <p>Being a chair for JAMUN was truly one of the most rewarding experiences of my Model UN journey. The delegates were excited and ready to open debate. Throughout the conference, they learned how to collaborate and respectfully debate with each other, fostering a welcoming community for young leaders. This sense of community is what makes JAMUN stand out, because it helps students grow into thoughtful and open-minded leaders.</p>

                <p>When I first joined MUN, I was just a freshman who had no clue what to do. My friends and I started the first Model UN team at our school, and we immediately began doing conferences. We had no guidance on how to write our position papers, and no idea what to expect from committee sessions. During our first conference, we spoke during debate once and only raised our placards during roll call, but we quickly learned how Model UN works and adapted to what was expected of us. Although none of us won any awards at the conference, we came away with a life-changing experience that would later set us up to be confident leaders within our community.</p>

                <p>Even though it wasn't a quick route to success, since our first conference I have gained invaluable skills in public speaking and quick thinking. Model UN doesn't require perfection—it rewards those who are able to adapt and show up ready to collaborate with others. If you are going into your first Model UN conference, or even if you are just unsure of where to start building connections with people in committee, just show up. Raise your placards, voice your opinions, but above all, have fun with it.</p>

                <p>For those of you who have done a Model UN conference before, you know how scary and anxious it can feel. Even with all the prep in the world, going out and talking in front of a room is challenging for anyone. That's why one of the most important things you can do in committee is take the initiative to talk to people. Collaboration is the most rewarding when you work with everyone, and not just your friends from school. Being able to expand and connect with others is not only a key quality of a good leader, but a key skill to help you in life.</p>

                <p>Leadership in MUN isn't about dominating, being the loudest, or talking the most. It's about being able to foster collaboration between everyone and build bridges where they usually couldn't be built. The best delegates are the ones who listen, ask questions, and include everyone in their groups and solutions.</p>

                <p>Similar to how I encourage you to reach out and help your fellow delegates, since the beginning of my Model UN journey I have been looking for ways to educate younger delegates and create spaces where they can learn about Model UN procedures. JAMUN has given me an opportunity to pass on what I've learned by creating a space where students can explore diplomacy, leadership, and engage with global issues. JAMUN is a learning conference where all are welcome—whether you are just getting started or whether this is your third conference, there is always a space for you at JAMUN.</p>

                <p>See you in committee.</p>
