            <h1>Building Relationships with Fellow Delegates</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">By Nolan Zinman | August 9, 2025 | Category: MUN Skills</p>

            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>A new committee might feel quite chaotic: lots of rules to keep up with, speeches presented, and resolutions written. But at its core, Model UN is a people game. Building strong relationships with your fellow delegates and practicing genuine diplomacy toward others can be the difference between drafting ignored clauses to uniting a passionate bloc that carries your ideas forward. So, how do you turn casual introductions into lasting alliances?</p>

                <p>To start off, you need to make the introduction yourself; sitting in silence and waiting for another delegate to initiate a conversation is never an optimal strategy. Next time you’re feeling nervous to speak up at the start of an unmoderated caucus, try turning to the delegate in the chair next to you and start with a “Hi,” introduce yourself, and possibly mention any key beliefs related to the topic that are important to your nation. I’ve felt that tense feeling before—walking into a committee barely knowing anyone, afraid to make any bad first impressions, glued to my seat. It can be hard to be open and extroverted in an environment like a Model UN committee. My go-to move is taking the previous advice a step further—introducing myself to other delegates before the committee even starts. Building relationships early shows both friendliness and confidence, which are two important qualities a high-achieving delegate should have.</p>

                <p>Next, after the first committee session has begun, look for delegates who share your country’s priorities—whether that’s climate action, human rights, or global health. A quick discussion over current agenda items often leads to discovering shared interests. “Oh, you’re interested in renewable energy, too? What are some specific aspects you’re passionate about?” From there, you can suggest creating or joining a bloc, co-writing a clause, or finding more delegates that share your interests.</p>

                <p>In addition, don’t undervalue the importance of small moments and interactions. A friendly “How’s your research coming along?” during a lunch break or a genuine compliment on someone’s speech in the last moderated caucus can create rapport. Think of these moments as a kind of diplomatic currency: they cost almost nothing yet build goodwill when it’s time to negotiate. By investing in these micro-interactions, you can create a network of allies who remember you as both approachable and collaborative, not just another voice in the room.</p>

                <p>Active listening is your secret weapon. As my fellow Secretary-General, Dustin Simon, discusses in his post “<a href=The-Delegate-Who-Listens>The Delegate Who Listens</a>,” you don’t always need to be the one speaking to be the one in control. Rather than preparing your next rebuttal while someone else speaks, focus on understanding their concerns. Ask clarifying questions: “Could you explain why your bloc prefers a voluntary payment plan over a mandatory tax?” Then paraphrase their answer: “So you believe being flexible is going to attract more participants, got it.” When delegates feel heard, they’re more open to negotiation and, most importantly, compromise.</p>

                <p>Of course, follow-through is essential. Exchanging goodbyes and last-second thoughts at the end of a session is only the first step. After the first day of the conference, send a brief note, perhaps suggesting an edit to be made or inquiring about a new clause: “Great work today! Here’s a draft of the clause we talked about after the 3rd session. Would love your feedback.” You’ll stand out as someone proactive and dependable, and a follow-up cements connections and shows you value others’ contributions.</p>

                <p>Finally, remember that diplomacy isn’t about winning at all costs. It’s about sharing success. Celebrate your allies’ victories as happily as your own. Their goodwill will pay dividends when you need their vote on your key amendments and resolutions. True diplomacy is an exchange of trust: you give support, and then you receive it in return.</p>

                <p>By weaving these strategies into your Model UN skill set—initiating an introduction, finding common ground, practicing small acts of diplomacy, active listening, following up, and mutual celebration—you’ll transform your conference experience. Your resolutions will carry more weight, your speeches will resonate with delegates and chairs, and you’ll quickly build a reputation as someone who makes others feel seen while making an impact themselves. After all, the vital piece to impactful diplomacy is building strong relationships.</p>
