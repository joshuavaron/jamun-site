            <p class="post-meta">By Abby Kettlewell | July 30, 2025 | Category: MUN Prep</p>

            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>When you approach the point in committee when someone motions for an unmoderated caucus, and it passes, what do you do? Here are some helpful tips on how to succeed in your first un-mod.</p>

                <p>What happens during an un-mod? Well, an un-mod is the part of committee when you are free to meet with other delegates to discuss solutions to the issue your committee is addressing. During this time, you will work together to write a resolution to solve the issue at hand. You must also garner support from other delegates to vote for your resolution.</p>

                <p>So, even if this is your first time at JAMUN or your last, here are some helpful tips on how to master the un-mod.</p>

                <h3>Know your goal</h3>
                <p>Every un-mod may look a little different, so try to stay focused on what the task is. Are you trying to form a bloc, draft your paper, or merge with another one?</p>

                <h3>Stand up!</h3>
                <p>Go talk to people! You don’t get anywhere by sitting in your chair the whole time. Get up and start conversations. I find it helpful to send delegates notes during moderated caucuses to try and align before an un-mod.</p>

                <h3>Build up your bloc</h3>
                <p>You want to have a bloc that includes differing perspectives. So reach out to the smaller blocs and see if they have similar ideas. It's okay to have different ideas, as long as you combine to make the most cohesive resolution.</p>

                <h3>Start writing!</h3>
                <p>Once you think you have enough people, start writing! It takes a long time to write, so the more time you can devote to it, the better. Start by getting everyone involved and sharing ideas; there may be some overlap, so it's best to get them out now before they appear in two different clauses.</p>

                <h3>Represent your country</h3>
                <p>Even though you are coming up with new ideas, don't forget about your country's policies. Represent your nation while still being innovative.</p>

                <h3>Involve everyone!</h3>
                <p>Don’t leave someone out of the bloc. Make sure that everyone is involved one way or another.</p>

                <h3>Garner support</h3>
                <p>Have people who are not writing the resolution talk to other nations to get signatories. Tell them the basic idea of your paper and ask if they would like to be signatories. The more signatories you have, the more likely people are to vote for you, and your resolution will have a better chance of passing.</p>

                <p>I hope that this was helpful for you all! If you have any questions, please feel free to send me an email at 281kettlewella@student.dist113.org.</p>

                <p>Good luck!<br/>Abby Kettlewell</p>

                    Abby Kettlewell is a sophomore at Deerfield High School with a strong passion for Model UN and international relations. Outside of MUN, she competes on the swim and water polo teams, loves to travel to new and exciting places, and is an avid reader. She has been a part of the JAMUN team, first serving in the crisis backroom and now as the Director of Crisis. Abby hopes JAMUN will give middle school students a chance to explore what they can do to make our world a better place.
